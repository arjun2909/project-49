<p>Cranes are powerful flyers, with some having the ability to fly over the Himalayas.</p>
<p>During migration cranes fly with their head and neck straight out and their feet and legs straight behind them</p>
<p>They live for about 20-30 years</p>

<p>There are two types of camels: One humped or “dromedary” camels and two humped Bactrian camels.</p>
<p>Camels have three sets of eyelids and two rows of eyelashes to keep sand out of their eyes.</p>
<p>Camels have thick lips which let them forage for thorny plants other animals can't eat.</p>
